Binary Tree:



Building a Binary Search tree!

Step-1:

where it contains the root node smaller value to the left, and 
larger value to the right...

Step-2:

to print the values we need to traversal the tree in three ways:

1.Inorder(left,root,right)
2.Preorder(root,left,right)
3.Postorder(left,right,root)

LevelOrder:

pass the root value to the queue and checkes and add its left and right node to the queue then,
the root node is added to the list.
