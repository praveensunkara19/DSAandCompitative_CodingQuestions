# DSA Problems and Competitive Coding Questions

This repository contains **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems and **competitive programming practice questions**.  
It is organized to help with interview preparation, coding contests, and strengthening core problem-solving skills.
* please look into **src** of each folder for .java files. coz i have uploaded the runnable java files form Eclipse IDE.
## 📂 Repository Structure

- **Data Structures and Algorithms** → Covers problems from:
  - Arrays  
  - Strings  
  - Searching & Sorting  
  - Stacks & Queues  
  - Linked Lists  
  - Trees  
  - Graphs  

  * look into overview.txt file for Concepts and the **Time & Space Complexity** for each algorithm.
