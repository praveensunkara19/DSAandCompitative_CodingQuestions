# DSA Problems and Competitive Coding Questions

This repository contains **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems and **competitive programming practice questions**.  
It is organized to help with interview preparation, coding contests, and strengthening core problem-solving skills.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **Data Structures and Algorithms** → Covers problems from:
  - Arrays  
  - Strings  
  - Searching & Sorting  
  - Stacks & Queues  
  - Linked Lists  
  - Trees  
  - Graphs  

  * look into overview.txt file for Concepts and the **Time & Space Complexity** for each algorithm.

---
- **3006computative coding**,**Coding_Hackathons**,**codingQuestions**,**InterviewWS**,**STS4007**,**UGCTraining**  - contain all the important question that asks in Assignments & Interviews for fresher placements to senior level jobs.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Navigate to the folder of interest (DSA, Hackathons, Interview prep, etc.).
2. Open the the folder and locate the src folder to run the .java files in Eclipse.
3. Compile and run to test solutions.

## 📘 Notes
- Problems range from **basic arrays** to **advanced graph algorithms**.
- Designed to support **coding interview preparation** and **competitive programming**.
