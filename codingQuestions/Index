3)Repeated string 
  count the repeated char in the infinite string  
  
4)The Utopian tree goes through 2 cycles of growth every year. 
	each spring it doubles it height, each summer it height increases by 1 meter.
	
	laura plants a utopina tree sapling with a height of 1 meter onset of spring. How tall will her
	tree be after n growth cycles.
	period   height
	0			1
	1			2
	2 			3
	4			6
	5			7
	
5)SparseArray
  There is collection of input string and collection of querry string. For each query string determine 
  how many times it occured in the list of input arrays.
  For example given input string = ['ab','ab','abc'] and query  = ['ab','abc','bc']. we find 2 of 'ab' ,
  1 instance of 'abc', and 0 instances of 'bc'. For each querry we add an element to our return array.
  result [2,1,0].
  Tip: use preprocessing for input string then compare with querry to save time.
